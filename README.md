### Hi, I’m Erick 👋

I’m an experienced **software engineer** with over 20 years in software development, team leadership, and mentoring. I’ve written millions of lines of code, helped create dozens of software products (some from scratch), and mentored over 4,000 people throughout my career as a developer, leader, and teacher.

Author of articles and books on [HTML, CSS, JavaScript](https://www.nteditora.com.br/e-tecnico/ver-produto?id=ImPD%2Fk0%3D), and [PHP](https://www.nteditora.com.br/e-tecnico/ver-produto?id=ImPC%2Bk4%3D), open-source contributor, and a recognized [Vue.js community partner](https://vuejs.org/about/team.html). My expertise spans a wide range of technologies, including:

- **Languages:**  JavaScript (ECMAScript), TypeScript, HTML, C#, PHP, SQL
- **Front-end technologies:** React, React Native, Vue, Nuxt, CSS, Tailwind, Lit (Polymer), Storybook
- **Back-end & databases:** Node.js, Prisma, MongoDB, Firebase, GraphQL, Docker, Google Cloud Platform, AWS
- **Other skills:** UI/UX design, accessibility, system architecture, quality assurance tools (Jest, Cypress, Selenium)

Holding a **Master's degree in Production Engineering** (emphasis on Lean Thinking applied to Software), **MBA in IT Management** (emphasis on Knowledge Management applied to Software Engineering Teams), **Technologist degree in Data Processing** (emphasis on Web Architecture and Development), I combine technical expertise with strategic thinking to deliver scalable, high-quality solutions.

I’ve been leading teams since I was 19, taking on roles such as Head of Engineering and Team Leader, while also teaching higher education for nearly 15 years. I’ve coached engineers to thrive in async, remote-first environments and helped scale engineering teams by adapting traditional Software Engineering practices with Agile methodologies.

- 👨‍🏫 Produced impactful software for educational institutions during my teaching career.
- 📚 Avid reader, hobbyist musician, amateur cook and interior designer, multidisciplinary lifelong learner.
